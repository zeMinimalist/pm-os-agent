# Agent Line Map: Cortex PM Chief-of-Staff Agent

> Module 1 · The Agent Line
>
> ✅ **What this validates:** every risky action has a clear owner, by the end you'll have proven an above/below-the-line map with HITL checkpoints, scored on reversibility, blast radius, and measurability.

## The workflow, decision by decision

List every discrete decision or action in your agent's workflow, then score each one and place it **above** the line (a human owns it) or **below** (the agent owns it). Borderline calls get an HITL checkpoint.

| Decision / action | Reversibility (H/M/L) | Blast radius (H/M/L) | Measurability (H/M/L) | Above / Below | HITL? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _Pull project state + recent GitHub/Jira activity_ | H | L | H | Below | · |
| _Draft the weekly leadership status update_ | H | M | M | Below | spot-check |
| _Propose next sprint's stories from the PRD (within cap)_ | M | M | M | Below | spot-check |
| _Post the update to a channel / commit a ship date_ | L | H | M | Above | required |
| _Mark a launch gate green / merge or close a ticket_ | L | H | M | Above | required |
| _…_ | | | | | |

## Agent anatomy (sketch)

- **Model:** _your default fast model + when you escalate to a frontier model, and why_
- **Tools:** _project + activity lookup (read) · past-update search · roadmap · team norms · story proposal (capped) …_
- **Memory:** _what persists across runs (roadmap, decisions, norms) vs. purged_
- **Loop:** _placeholder, defined in M2 loop-spec.md_
- **Bounds:** _placeholder, defined in M5 bounds-and-evals.md_
- **Evals:** _placeholder, defined in M5 bounds-and-evals.md_

## The golden rule, applied

_One sentence per above-the-line decision: why it stays human (which of reversibility / blast radius / measurability failed)._

## Hardest call

_Your toughest "above vs below" decision and how you resolved it. (Share this in `#cohort-channel`.)_
